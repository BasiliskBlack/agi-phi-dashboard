  <h3>AI-Powered Operating System Interface</h3>
  <p>A revolutionary AI-driven OS with golden ratio optimization</p>
</div>

## Overview

Phixeo OS is a cutting-edge AI-powered operating system interface that combines Phixeo's innovative programming language with advanced artificial intelligence capabilities. It leverages the golden ratio (φ = 1.618...) for optimal performance, efficiency, and aesthetics.

Key features:
- **Phixeo Language**: Custom programming language with reduced verbosity
- **Golden Ratio Optimization**: Algorithm optimization using phi-based patterns
- **AI Code Analysis**: Automatic code analysis and improvement suggestions
- **Visual Programming**: Intuitive visual programming interfaces
- **Self-Improvement**: System automatically suggests improvements

## One-Command Deployment

Phixeo OS can be deployed with a single command from the `/Phixeo` directory:

```bash
# For Replit deployment
./phixeo

# Or use:
node phixeo-deploy.js
```

This will automatically:
1. Prepare the deployment configuration
2. Build the optimized production version
3. Initialize the deployment process
4. Provide a deployment URL

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Shadcn UI components, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js, OpenAI integration
- **Optimization**: Golden ratio algorithms, fractal patterns
- **Visualization**: Phixeo visual programming components
- **AI**: Advanced natural language processing, code optimization

## Golden Ratio Principles

Phixeo OS is built around the mathematical constant φ (phi), which appears throughout the system:

- User interface layouts follow golden ratio proportions
- Algorithm optimization uses phi-based constants
- Code refactoring targets phi-efficiency metrics
- Animation timing uses phi sequences
- Component hierarchy follows the Fibonacci sequence (related to phi)
